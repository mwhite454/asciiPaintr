# asciiPaintr
Simple JQuery toy for painting with letters

TODO
* Clean up style.css - many linting issues (gasp - styles on ID's)
* Add rapid straight line option that fills entire row or column on a single click
* Port to straight JS as practice
* Last 'pixel' of long drag does not remain 'painted' after mouseup
